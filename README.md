     - The UV index will be presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
        - Favorable: Green
        - Moderate: Yellow
        - Severe: Red

    - The Temperature will show in Fahrenheit.
        ```html
        -> Convertion used

        F = C x 1.8 + 32
        C = K - 273.15 
    
        F = (K - 273.15) x 1.8 + 32 

        -> Funtion that handle convertion:

        function k2f(K) {
            return Math.floor((K - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32);
        }
        ```

         > If you want a different unit, here are a list of convertions:

        ```html
            Converting Temperatures

            It is sometimes necessary to convert temperature from one scale to another. Here is how to do this.

            1. To convert from oC to oF, use the formula: oF = oC x 1.8 + 32.
            2. To convert from oF to oC, use the formula: oC = (oF-32) ÷ 1.8.
            3. To convert from K to oC, use the formula: oC = K – 273.15
            4. To convert from oC to K, use the formula: K = oC + 273.15.
            5. To convert from oF to K, use the formula: K = 5/9 (oF – 32) + 273.15.
            6. To convert from K to oF, use the formula: oF = 1.8(K – 273.15) + 32.

          -> Having the convertion you would like to use, replace it in this function:

            function k2f(K) {
                return Math.floor("insert convertion to use");
            }
        
         ```

- Will display Future weather conditions for that city presenting the next 5 days showing a list with date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

- City search will be added to a history and displaye below.

- Clicking on a city in the search history will display current and future conditions for that city

- Will allow to clear the history.
